Hi, I am /u/DotoBot and help out on /r/dota2modding.

You submitted '[{1}](http://redd.it/{0})' to our subreddit but forgot **to flair it**! We would love to index it in our database over on [moddota.com](http://moddota.com), but without a flair, I can't process your thread. **Can you please flair it?**

In case you don't know how to flair your content: Go to your **[thread](http://redd.it/{0})** and on the **[bottom of your entry you will see 'flair' showing up](http://i.imgur.com/9k4eNm8.png)** - click it, flair it, you're good to go!
